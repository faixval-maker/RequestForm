My GitHub Pages Website
This is a 100% free static website hosted on GitHub Pages, with a custom HTML/CSS/JS form that sends data to a Google Sheets backend using Google Apps Script.

How it works
The form in index.html sends data using fetch() from script.js.
Google Apps Script receives the data through a Web App endpoint.
The script appends the values into Google Sheets automatically.
